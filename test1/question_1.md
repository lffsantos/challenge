Development of the Data Management Platform (DMP) platform. A platform for Management.
What made me most proud of this project was the fact that I was starting with Python and Django development and being able to develop a platform of extreme value for the customer. With this platform, the customer had an overview of its users and was thus able to create better marketing strategies.
It was the end product for our client, so knowing that he was using the product developed by you and this passing the positive feedback is very rewarding.
Thinking from the user side, it's great to know that your work impacts millions of peoples,  when a user entered our client's site, he was impacted directly by our work, seeing advertising specific to it, and to impact people's lives is priceless.
The insights I took, was the issue that technology isn't the most important, the main is to meet customer expectations. During the project, I researched several technologies because I see them technology as a means and not an end.
